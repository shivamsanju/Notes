## Cohesion

- Cohesion is the degree to which elements of a certain class and elements belong together.
- A function with strong cohesion performs only one thing. High cohesion is good.

## Coupling

- Coupling is a measure of how dependent two parts of your code are on each other.
- High coupling is not good. As we have to change more code if something changes.

## How to have good cohesivity and less coupling

- Start looking for information and create classes around them
- Try to create methods in classes which has the data required for that function
